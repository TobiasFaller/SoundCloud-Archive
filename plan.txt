Issues:

* 'publicly' - not all 'public' playlists are displayed.  So initial playlists with
urls will need to be aggregated with the Soundcloud API (shouldn't grow larger than 50 - 200)

* selenium script will only be used for scraping individual track links

Specific flows:
--------------.

* track scraper *

- pass in url from DB for nth set
- if(can't assert bottom elem) -> break into whileTrue -> scroll down **px -> if(bottom present) BREAK



- count length of finds for each scroll if(len(finds)) doesn't change for 10 updates -> break
- identify bottom track (last element of 'finds') if(finds[last elem]) doesnt change -> break
